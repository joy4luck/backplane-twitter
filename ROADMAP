IMMEDIATE BUGS:
- modify collection script to include new data + use classifier

- pickle the classifier once we have it

BACKLOGGED BUGS:
- Currently, the collection only chooses tweets by day, so the data is all
  a few hours from midnight. Figure out how to sample different times
  of the day/the whole week.

GENERAL MODEL:
  Simple regression tree. Initial branching on the number of followers that the
  original poster had. X variables undetermined for now, but some subset or
  combination of the "static" variables that should not change for the duration
  of the 1 hour "retweet window" of a tweet. i.e. tweet features (minus current
  number of tweets, which will change while the tweet is young), tweeter
  features, possibly historical behavior of the tweeter/related tweets.

  y = num of tweets
  # properties of the user
  x1.followers
  x2.friends
  x3.listed
  x4.average_retweets_of_users_past_tweets
  # properties of the tweet
  x5.num_hashtags
  x6.num_urls
  x7.char_length
  x8.in_reply_to (binary)

METRIC:
  1. Accuracy of predicting whether or not a tweet will be retweeted at all.
    - Percantage correctly binned
  2. Accuracy of predicting how many retweets.
    - Percentage error from correct

TRAINING:
  - Grab half the dataset.
  - Optimize for predicting retweets.

VALIDATION:
  - Grab other half of the dataset.
  - Predict and score.

TESTING (ONLINE TESTING):
  - grab tweets and filter for ones that are 5 minutes or younger.
  - predict the number of tweets that it will have.
  - grab the same tweets again in an hour. Predict and score.
