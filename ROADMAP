IMMEDIATE BUGS:
- Features:
  Hashtags
  URL

- Clean up created_at date string so it can be compared with current time.

- Currently, the collection only chooses tweets by day, so the data is all
  a few hours from midnight. Figure out how to sample different times
  of the day/the whole week.

GENERAL MODEL:
  Simple regression tree. Initial branching on the number of followers that the
  original poster had. X variables undetermined for now, but some subset or
  combination of the "static" variables that should not change for the duration
  of the 1 hour "retweet window" of a tweet. i.e. tweet features (minus current
  number of tweets, which will change while the tweet is young), tweeter
  features, possibly historical behavior of the tweeter/related tweets.

TRAINING:
  - Grab half the dataset.
  - Optimize for predicting retweets.

VALIDATION:
  - Grab other half of the dataset.
  - Predict and score.

TESTING (ONLINE TESTING):
  - grab tweets and filter for ones that are 5 minutes or younger.
  - predict the number of tweets that it will have.
  - grab the same tweets again in an hour. Predict and score.
